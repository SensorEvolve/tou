🛡️ Privacy Policy for Tarot of Us (Minimal Data Collection)
Last updated: 2025-11-25

We are deeply committed to protecting your privacy. We believe that deep, meaningful connection is best fostered when users feel completely secure.

The core principle of this policy is simple: We do not collect any Personal Identifiable Information (PII) from our users.

1. The Principle of Non-Collection
We do not collect, store, or transmit any Personal Data. This means:

We do not require accounts or logins.

We do not collect emails, names, or addresses.

We do not track your device for behavioral advertising purposes.

We do not save your conversations, Tarot readings, or answers on any external server.

2. User Generated Content is Local
The powerful, insightful content generated while using the App—your answers to the Heart, Shadow, Spirit, and Trickster questions, along with any saved Tarot Readings or notes—is stored only on your device.

This data is never sent to us or any third party. If you delete the App, this data is erased.

3. Automatically Collected (Non-Personal) Data
The only data collected is non-personal, anonymous data gathered and aggregated by the mobile platform (Apple App Store or Google Play) itself for technical purposes. This data helps us ensure the App is stable and functional.

This "Usage Data" typically includes:

Crash Reports: Anonymized logs to help fix bugs and app crashes.

Performance Metrics: Aggregated data on app usage (e.g., how often the app is opened).

Geo-Statistics: The general region or "land" (country) from which the App was downloaded, used only for broad, statistical understanding of our user base.

This data is processed by the platform providers (Apple/Google) and is not linked back to any identifiable individual.

4. Third-Party Services
Because we do not track or use third-party behavioral advertising, the only third parties involved are the hosting platforms themselves (Apple/Google).

5. GDPR and Your Rights (EU/EEA Users)
As we do not collect or store your Personal Data, there is no data for us to provide access to, rectify, or delete.

However, in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we affirm your fundamental rights, including the Right to be Informed—which this policy fulfills by confirming our policy of non-collection. If we were ever to change this policy and begin collecting PII, we would notify you immediately.

6. Children's Privacy
Our App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13.

7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this policy to reflect changes in our App's functionality or legal obligations. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Policy within the App's settings menu.
